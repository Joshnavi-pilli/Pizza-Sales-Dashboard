1. **Total Revenue**: Sum of total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: Total revenue divided by total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: Total quantity of pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: Number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: Total pizzas sold divided by total orders.

## üìä Charts & Visuals

- **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: Visualizes patterns in daily order volume.
- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: Shows monthly fluctuation in sales.
- **% Sales by Pizza Category/Size**: Pie charts showing market share by category and size.
- **Top/Bottom 5 Sellers**: Bar charts for best and worst-selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and order count.
- **Funnel Chart**: Breakdown of pizzas sold by category.

## SQL Queries

Data used in the dashboard was extracted with the following example SQL scripts (`sql-queries-for-pizza_db.txt`):

- **Total Revenue**:  
  `SELECT SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue FROM pizza_sales`

- **Average Order Value**:  
  `SELECT SUM(total_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS avg_order_value FROM pizza_sales`

- **Total Pizzas Sold**:  
  `SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_pizzas_sold FROM pizza_sales`

- **Top 5 Sellers by Revenue**:  
  `SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY pizza_name ORDER BY total_revenue DESC`
